# Data

Data for the article "Influence of fluids on earthquakes based on numerical modeling" to Journal of Geophysical Research - Solid Earth. The section method in this article describes the numerical models where the data contained in the differente folders are generated (i.e., shear stress, slip, fault velocity, etc.).

"Plotter_script.m" file is the Matlab script for plotting results showing in the article.

"Velocity_Stress_data.xlsx" file is an excel file with average stress drop (MPa), average rupture velocity (m/s), average peak slip velocity (m/s), pore-fluid factor at the onset of fault slip, and average shear stress at the onset of fault slip (MPa) data.
